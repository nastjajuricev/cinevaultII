Overall Style Direction
Create a minimalist, typography-focused website inspired by Spin Studio's (spin.co.uk) visual language but customized for a freelance graphic designer. Maintain their clean, professional aesthetic with ample white space and bold typography.
Layout & Structure

Header: Minimal header with designer's name/logo on the left, navigation on the right
Hero Section: Full-width background image (to be replaced with designer's own imagery) with a bold, centered headline statement about design philosophy
Homepage: Simple grid layout of featured projects with minimal text
Navigation: Simple text-only navigation menu with: "Work", "About", "Contact", "Journal" (similar to Spin, but replace "Gallery" with "Contact")

Typography

Use typography as a key visual element
Primary font: Sans-serif font family (similar to Spin's use of plain, confident typography)
Limited font sizes (2-3 max) with clear hierarchy
Headlines should be bold, uppercase, and impactful
Body text should be clean, legible, and minimal

Color Palette

Predominantly black text on white background
Limited color usage - consider a single accent color for interactive elements
High contrast between elements

Content Style

Brief, confident, slightly playful but professional writing style
Use punchy, concise statements rather than lengthy explanations
Adopt Spin's straightforward tone: "We develop ideas that connect brands with audiences," becomes something like "I craft visual stories that make brands unforgettable"
Incorporate occasional creative language while maintaining professionalism

Project Display

Large, impactful project imagery
Minimal project descriptions
Clean grid layout with ample whitespace between projects
Hover effects should be subtle (similar to Spin's approach)

Contact Section

Clean, minimal contact form
Direct, approachable invitation to get in touch
Include social media links if applicable
Consider adding a brief statement about your approach to client work

Responsive Considerations

Maintain the clean, minimal aesthetic across all devices
Simplified navigation for mobile (possibly hamburger menu)
Ensure large typography remains impactful but not overwhelming on smaller screens

Technical Notes

Fast loading times are essential
Clean page transitions similar to Spin's website
Consider minimal animations only where they enhance user experience
Ensure all text is easily readable against background images
